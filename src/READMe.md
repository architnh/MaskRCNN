Steps to run the code

There are two python notebooks in our submission zip file. 
1) RPN_final_project_RB_AH 
Open this notebok and download all the corresponding library requirements and import them. Make sure all the dependencies are met.
Provide the correct path to the dataset and pretrained models wherever needed.Run all the cells one after the other to train the network and visualize the output.
All the util functions and Dataset class loader are already included in the notebook.

2) MaskRCNN_final_project_RB_AH
This notebook has the code to train BoxHead and MaskHead networks and visualize the results.
Provide the correct path to the pretrained model of rpn inside BoxHead class as well as the MaskHead class.
Run all the cells to train the network individually. 
All the util functions and classes required to train the networks are included in the python notebook.
